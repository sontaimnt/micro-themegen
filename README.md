# micro-themegen
A simple theme generator for the micro editor written in python

# todo:-

- [ ] hex code detection
- [ ] beautiful ui

# why it is created?
As a `nano` lover `micro` is something which imprives nano significantly and not only it is better with vim but by default it provides a lot of features. i prefer it over `vim` and `vim` has a lot of theme gen but micro aint have one
